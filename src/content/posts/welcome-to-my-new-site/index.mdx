Hello all and welcome to my new portfolio! As you probably know by now my name is Joshua, and i'm a front-end web developer. Upon graduating from the Web Design & Interactive media program at Humber College, i was able to get my first job developing custom WordPress & Shopify themes at [UV Designs](https://www.uvdesigns.ca), a local web design & marketing company.

When im, not working with WordPress or Shopfiy, i really enjoy playing with React. I've been recently exploring the "JAMstack", which is a method of developing websites using JavaScript, API's & Markup. My new portfolio is actually built using the JAMstack, specifically with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a React based frontend framework.

> "The JAMStack" is a new way of building websites and apps that deliver better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling and better developer experience." - [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/)

- Web Design & Development
- WordPress
- Shopify
- JavaScript & React
- Gatsby
- Headless CMS's
- Taco Reviews (Just kidding... maybe)
